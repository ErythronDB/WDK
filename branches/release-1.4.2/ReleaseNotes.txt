WDK Version 1.5

Model - Fixed Bugs

   * Fixed the SQL query replacement code which couldn't handle keywords (e.g. "select", "where") of 
     different cases. For example, to find the first select statement, it first check upper case of "select",
     then lower case. If the first SELECT is in lower case, while other SELECT in lower case, that piece
     of code would fail. Now it can handle any cases of those keywords.

   * Made the SQL query replacement code to support UNION queries, as well as INTERSECT and EXCEPT

Model - Features

   * Provide support for federated primary key. Now the primary key can be a combination of project_id and
     local_primary_key, where project_id is a unique name-id pair that identifies the GUS instance involved
     in the federated system, and local_primary_key is the current key used to identify the piece of
     information, such as locus_tag, source_id, etc.

   * Provide backward compatibility to the current non-federation models; that is, the federated key is
     totally options.
