WDK Version 1.3

Model - Fixed Bugs

   * An attribute query is configured to handle situations where no values are returned for a particular
     record.  This is distinct from the case where a row is returned consisting of null values; this
     is found most often where an attribute query runs against a table with a foreign key to the
     original record.  This bug occurred both in the context of a normal Record, and also when a Record
     was used as part of a Summary.

   * Fixed some database connection leaks.

   * Fixed boolean question result caching not distinguished by boolean operation error.

   * Null values in joining queries no longer throws an error.

   * AttributeFieldValue truncate is no longer off by one.

   * Fixed the problem where recordInstances have attribute values from other records on summary page.

Model - Features

   * Provided support for postgres.

   * A Record now can have one or more NestedRecords and one or more NestedRecordLists.  A NestedRecord is
     another Record that is obtained from a query that uses values of the original record as its
     parameter values.  The query is internal to the user and is specified in the model.  A
     NestedRecordList is the same as a NestedRecord except the query returns a list of primary keys,
     each of which represents a Record (all Records in the NestedRecordList are of the same RecordClass).

   * QuestionSets now have "isInternal" as an attribute.  When set, views on the model can decide whether
     to hide QuestionSets (for example, if the QuestionSet contains NestedQuestions which aren't intended
     for view by the user).

Controller - Fixed Bugs

   * Boolean queries with multipick parameters now use all values of the multipick.

Controller - Features

View - Fixed Bugs

   * Boolean queries with multipick parameters now use all values of the multipick.

   * Fixed database connection leak in the context of displaying table attributes of a record instance.

View - Features

   * The View is equipped to handle NestedRecords and NestedRecordLists; it displays them in the Record page.

   * The View will only display QuestionSets if their "isInternal" flag is not set.
