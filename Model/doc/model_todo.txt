To Do

NEW

 - update tutorial (include wdkCache)

 - SqlEnumParam not working?

 - document that the queries may be in a "create table as" context

 - wdkQuery: if -querySet or -query omitted, list the available query sets and queries

 - how do we define complex parameter value constraints in the XML?   There are these
   types of constraints:
     - simple (eg regex, min, max) which are easy in XML
     - logic (require a programming language, eg, length must be even number
     - cross-param constraints (eg, width < length)



SORTED AND PRIORITIZED

General

 - logging

 - error handling during parse of model xml file

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - use webinstall for WDKTestSite

 - DTD/XmlSchema for WdkXml?

 - Javadocs (generated by build system)
 
 - importing model xml files into each other


 - where do we specify multi-column transforms (eg, use use ext_db_id to decide which url to use)

 - make test suite

 - do we need a ModelDefinitionException?

UserQueries

 - virtual query sets (sets of queries already defined elsewhere)

 - allow param refs

 - boolean queries

 - associate additional info with query result columns, such as URLs, help

 - prevent detail query instance from being cached

 - abstract ResultSet into TableResult

-------------------------------------------------------------------

 - abstract SqlEnumParam into ControlledVocabParam

 - also... handle CVs in different forms (list, tree, graph)

 - handle re-usable params from a separate file (importing params)

 - flat file queries

 - process queries

 - define page queries as a set of modular queries (a la report maker).  and, instead of returning result set, return abstract result with accessor methods that trigger the queries.



Records

 - For table results, use declared columns to provide default heading names

 - implement specialDataTypes

 - column names must be lower case.  throw exception if not


DONE

 - use connection pool

 - complete implementation of SqlEnumParam (uses DB connection)

 - implement simple questionViewer

 - cache results

 - records: figure out basic architecture:  generic v. generated beans
