To Do

NEW
 - make test suite

 - improve the output of wdkXml (use indenting)

 - factor the various Tester classes.

 - factor the various Set classes?

 - update tutorial (include wdkCache)

 - document that the queries may be in a "create table as" context

 - wdkQuery: 
       - if -querySet or -query omitted, list the available query sets and queries
       - if -queryLists, show all queryLists
       - offer a -sqlDebug mode which shows all sql

 - how do we define complex parameter value constraints in the XML?   There are these
   types of constraints:
     - simple (eg regex, min, max) which are easy in XML
     - logic (require a programming language, eg, length must be even number
     - cross-param constraints (eg, width < length)

 - model should have all queries check their derived columns (to make sure that they are interpolating valid column names)

SORTED AND PRIORITIZED

General

 - logging

 - configuration

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - use webinstall for WDKTestSite

 - Javadocs (generated by build system)
 
 - importing model xml files into each other

 - make test suite

UserQueries

 - allow param refs

 - boolean queries

-------------------------------------------------------------------

 - also... handle CVs in different forms (list, tree, graph)

 - handle re-usable params from a separate file (importing params)

 - flat file queries

 - process queries



Records

 - implement specialDataTypes

 - column names must be lower case.  throw exception if not


DONE

 - abstract SqlEnumParam into ControlledVocabParam

 - use connection pool

 - complete implementation of SqlEnumParam (uses DB connection)

 - implement simple questionViewer

 - cache results

 - records: figure out basic architecture:  generic v. generated beans

 - virtual query sets (sets of queries already defined elsewhere)

 - abstract ResultSet into TableResult

 - associate additional info with query result columns, such as URLs, help

 - define page queries as a set of modular queries (a la report maker).  and, instead of returning result set, return abstract result with accessor methods that trigger the queries.

 - For table results, use declared columns to provide default heading names

 - error handling during parse of model xml file

 - DTD/XmlSchema for WdkXml?
