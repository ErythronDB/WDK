WDKTestSite problems
-- if model has bad sql (eg select x, y, from T), the site simply shows
   blanks (side by side with results of other queries, if any)
-- changes in the database (eg list of taxons) does not get picked up
   until webapp reload (wdkCache reset does not help)

testModelRNG.xml:

-- rename to: toyModel.xml
-- rename model to toyModel and loose all WTS prefixes
-- move summarySet to top
-- name summarySet "RnaSummaries"
-- loose prefixes in summary names
-- only one record: RnaRecord (has is summary status)
-- name recordSet: RnaRecords with one Record: RnaRecord
-- put all 5 RnaQueries in same querySet
-- put all Rna Record attribute queries in one set
-- put all Rna Record table queries in one set
-- use xml commenting to comment all sets and queries
-- keep query set for params (vocabqueries)
-- preference is to have summary and query with the same name
-- all params should use prompts and help, and sample if necessary
-- keep one paramSet until it is necessary to divide
-- loose queries to minimize the need to extend toy db
-- keep at least one query that uses more than one param, 
   and one that use vocab param, and one that uses '>'
