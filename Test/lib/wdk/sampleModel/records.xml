    A "record" is an object that gathers together data about an entity in the
    database.  The entity is defined as data associated with a primary key,
    and data in the record is based on that key. The data comes in three forms:
    attributes, text attributes and tables.  An attribute is a single value
    that describes the entity, such as "size."  A text attribute is similar,
    but the value is created by defining a text string and optionally embedding
    into that string the values of other attributes.  A table is a value
    in the form of columns and rows, such as a table describing related
    publications.

    A record class is a template for creating records from a given primary key.
    It includes "attribute queries," "table queries" and "text attributes."

    An attribute query must have only one parameter, the primary key.  It must
    return exactly zero or one rows.  The columns in the query are interpreted
    as attributes of the record.

    A text attribute has a body of text with the values of other attributes
    optionally embedded in it.  The other attribute values are referred to
    as variables of the form "$$name_of_attribute$$".

    A table query must have only one parameter, the primary key.  It may
    return any number of rows (but typically not a huge number).  The result
    of the query is interpreted as being a table that

    A "record set" is a grouping of records. It is useful in organizing the
    model xml file.

    The full name of a record is is of the form "set_name.name."
