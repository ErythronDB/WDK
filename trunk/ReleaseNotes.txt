ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  WDK Version 1.7  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  BooleanExpression concepts; the relevant jspwrappers for the view; wdkUnitTest
  focused on unit testing for query history.

  manually copied to the common/lib dir of Tomcat (or other webservers) to avoid
  problems of multiple webapps interfering with each other under the same server.

  handler Java CLASSPATH and args for all tools needing them.

  only operates on answers with exactly the same record type.

  organized by the record types of answers and ordered by answer IDs
  in descending order.

  record of an answer to be included in downloads, even if they are not
  specified as one of the summary attributes by the question

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  WDK Version 1.5  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Model - Fixed Bugs

   * 22, SQL query replacement code couldn't handle keywords (e.g. "select", "where") of 
     different cases. Now a case insensitive seach is in place.

   * 56, naive parsing of attribute query SQL to join with id query result
     cache table might result in non-functional SQL in many non-trivial cases.
     Implemented quick fix for simple cases, more robust solution proposed
     in tracker item 57.

   * 82, wdkSummary throws exception on uncached attribute queries.
     Note isCacheable attribute for attributes queries does not matter - 
     it is intended for id queries instead. However the model does have bug
     when it reads this value in determining whether to check for
     the multi-mode column in the mangled attribute query.

   * Made the SQL query replacement code to support UNION queries, as well as INTERSECT and EXCEPT


Model - Features

   * add -showQuery option to wdkQuery and wdkSummary command to print out the SQL

   * Provide support for federated primary key. Now the primary key can be a combination of project_id and
     local_primary_key, where project_id is a unique name-id pair that identifies the GUS instance involved
     in the federated system, and local_primary_key is the current key used to identify the piece of
     information, such as locus_tag, source_id, etc.

   * Provide backward compatibility to the current non-federation models; that is, the federated key is
     totally options.


Controller - Fixed Bugs


Controller - Features

   * Provide support for federated primary key.


View - Fixed Bugs
   * 76, record page showing Federation specific headings such as Project ID

View - Features

   * Provide support for federated primary key.

   * Allow questionSets to be displayed either as a flattened list of quesitons
     (cp index.jsp.flat to index.jsp) or as drop down lists, each of which
     representing a questionSet (cp index.jsp.sets to index.jsp).

   * Added custom page hooks (under customPages/) so that you do not need to
     modify default view files in order to customize your site:
     I) site wide customizations:
        questionSets.jsp      --  customQuestionSets.jsp
        question.jsp          --  customQuestion.jsp
        questionSetsFlat.jsp  --  customQuestionSetsFlat.jsp
        summary.jsp           --  customSummary.jsp
        record.jsp            --  customRecord.jsp
     II) record-type specific customizations:
        question.jsp          --  <RecordClassSet>.<RecordClass>.question.jsp
        summary.jsp           --  <RecordClassSet>.<RecordClass>.summary.jsp
        record.jsp            --  <RecordClassSet>.<RecordClass>.jsp
     III) question-name specific customizations:
        question.jsp          --  <QuestionSet>.<Question>.jsp
        summary.jsp           --  <QuestionSet>.<Question>.summary.jsp
     Note: 1) there is no .question in <QuestionSet>.<Question>.jsp
           2) there is no .record in <RecordClassSet>.<RecordClass>.jsp
           3) more specific customization take precedence when more than one
              levels of customization exist for the same default view.
