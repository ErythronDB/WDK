WDK Version 1.2

Model - Fixed Bugs

   * Now correctly handling sql queries that have quoted primary keys.

   * Added special handling for processing Clob values retrieved from an SQL ResultSet

   * Sanity test now uses Strings for its primary keys rather than Integers.

Model - Features

   * The model now preserves the order of query results as they are returned by the SQL ResultSet.

   * Allow the user to define the set of attributes that the Summary displays as a subset of all
     attributes for the Summary's Question.

   * When two Questions are joined into an Expanded Question, the Summary attributes displayed in
     the Expanded Summary are those in the union of the Summary attributes defined for each individual
     Question.

   * Allow the user to define the ordering of the columns that a Summary displays.

   * Allow the user to define a stable unique identifier as the primary key for a Record instead of 
     restricting the identifier to a table's Primary Key.

   * Allow the user to specify attribute truncating for all attributes and sequences in particular.  Created
     a global default of 100 characters if no truncating is specified.

   * Updated Regression Test with new command line arguments; decommissioned Regression Test
     except for internal testing.


Controller - Fixed Bugs

   * When a FlatVocabParam's multi-pick feature is enabled in the model, fixed the bug that was 
     only processing the first value instead of all selected values.

   * Fixed error that occurred when submitting an expanded Question with only one entry in the 
     Expanded Question Page.

View - Fixed Bugs


View - Features

   * When a FlatVocabParam's multi-pick feature is enabled in the model, use a scrollpane to display 
     params; otherwise, use a pulldown menu.  Added this to both normal Questions and expanded Questions.

   * A record detail page now displays a Clob in its entirety; long sequences are wrapped so 
     they don't trail off the screen

   * Stable unique identifier is always present in a summary, and comes first in the column order.
