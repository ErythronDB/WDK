<p>This is the intro page to the (soon-to-be defunct) sampleWDK site. The purpose 
of the sampleWDK site is demonstrate how to put together a site based on the 
new web development kit (WDK). 

<p>We have a <a href="simpleQueryDemo1.jsp">queries page</a>. This first lets you choose 
a query and then run it.

<p>There's also a comprehensive <a href="admin/">WDK administration page</a> 
available. This has proven to be essential during development, as well as for 
day-to-day monitoring.
